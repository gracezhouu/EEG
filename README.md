What domain-specific features did you use ?
There are two major kinds of event related activity that we can extract from EEG.

The first one is called Event Related Potential (ERP), and is characterized by a phase-locked, time-domain waveform that appears in response to a stimulation. ERP are without any doubt the most studied type of activity in EEG. The BCI challenge and the DecMeg2014 challenge were about classification of ERP. Typical features are time-domain signal, generally averaged across several repetitions of the stimulation in order to increase the signal to noise ratio.
